# Linear LightSpec Optimiser
#### Fast, Accurate, Build-Ready Photometric Files

![Evolt Logo](evolt log original.png)

## 🚀 Overview
Linear LightSpec Optimiser is a rapid IES file generator and optimisation tool for Lighting Designers, Engineers, BDMs, and Evolt's Internal Engineers.

With this tool, you can fine-tune luminaire outputs, configure mm-accurate buildable lengths, and export AGI32/DIALux compliant IES files in seconds.

- ✅ Editable End Plates & LED Pitch (with confirmation lock)
- ✅ Optimise for Target Lux & Achieved Lux Inputs
- ✅ LED Efficiency Gain Input (% based adjustment)
- ✅ Live Efficacy and Wattage Recalculations
- ✅ Multiple Length Generation (1m, 2m, 4.5m, custom)
- ✅ AGI32/DIALux Compliant LM-63-2002 IES Export
- ✅ Download Multiple IES Files in a Single ZIP

## 🖥️ How to Run Locally
1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/linear-lightspec-optimiser.git
cd linear-lightspec-optimiser
```

2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the Streamlit App**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

## 🌐 Deploy on Streamlit Cloud
1. Link this repo to [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud)
2. Select `app.py` as the main file
3. Streamlit Cloud automatically installs the requirements
4. Share your app link (e.g., https://linear-lightspec-optimiser.streamlit.app/)

---

## ✅ Example Workflow
- Upload a base IES file
- Enter Achieved Lux and Target Lux
- Apply LED Efficiency Gain %
- Select a buildable length (shorter/longer)
- Confirm component settings (if edited)
- Generate optimised IES files for multiple lengths
- Download as ZIP
