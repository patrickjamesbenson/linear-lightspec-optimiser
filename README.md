Linear LightSpec Optimiser
Fast, Accurate, Build-Ready Photometric Files
🚀 Overview
Linear LightSpec Optimiser is a rapid IES file generator and optimisation tool for Lighting Designers, Engineers, BDMs, and Evolt's Internal Engineers.
With this tool, you can fine-tune luminaire outputs, configure mm-accurate buildable lengths, and export AGI32/DIALux compliant IES files in seconds.

🔧 Features
 ✅ Live Length Validation (buildable lengths only)
 ✅ Editable End Plate Expansion Gutter & LED "Series Module" Pitch (with confirmation lock)
 ✅ Optimise for Target Lux & Achieved Lux Inputs (Lighting Design Efficiency Optimisation)
 ✅ LED Efficiency Gain Input (% based adjustment) + Reason Tracking
 ✅ Live Efficacy and Wattage Recalculations with Visual Feedback (Green/Red Highlights)
 ✅ Multiple Length Generation (1m, 2m, 4.5m, custom)
 ✅ AGI32/DIALux Compliant LM-63-2002 IES Export
 ✅ Download Multiple IES Files + Summary CSV in a Single ZIP
 ✅ Re-importable ZIP Files for Continuous Optimisation
 ✅ 0.5 Second Splash Screen with Evolt Branding ("So much more than light") on App Launch

✅ Example Workflow
Upload a base IES file
Review Base Length & Metadata
Enter Achieved Lux and Target Lux
Apply LED Efficiency Gain % (Add Reason)
Select Buildable Lengths (shorter/longer)
Confirm component settings (if edited)
Review Comparison Table (Base vs Optimised Data)
Export Optimised IES Files + Summary CSV
Re-import for continuous optimisation

🚀 BDM Pricing & Strategy Guidance

🚧 Development in Progress 🚧
Our Wholesale/Project BDMs are often engaged late in the project lifecycle during Value Engineering (VE) phases. While reducing features to meet price pressures can be effective, premature downgrading can erode both margin and positioning.
Start High, Stay High
Begin with Professional or Bespoke specifications whenever possible.
Present the high-performance solution first to maintain perceived value.
Only downgrade features after understanding the contractor or builder's motivations.
When to Adjust Pricing
Reduce specification only when necessary for VE or cost pressures.
Track reductions clearly in the Product Tier Matrix and communicate the impact on performance, longevity, and warranty.
Key Message to BDMs
“Hold the line on value. A high spec system establishes credibility and performance. Know when to adjust—but never lead with your lowest offer.”
Further development on automated tier guidance and margin tracking is underway.

🌱 Future Options & Development Roadmap
🚧 Ideas Under Review & Development 🚧
Automated Tier Guidance: real-time feedback for BDMs and specifiers on selected options impact.
Integrated Margin Tracker: highlight potential margin erosion and suggest alternatives.
Product Tier History Log: track and compare initial specs vs. VE adjustments over project lifecycle.
Dynamic Lead Time Calculation: based on selected customisations and tier.
Evolt Product Selector Integration: enable selection of Core / Advanced / Professional / Bespoke product families directly in the tool.
API Export: direct connection to Evolt ERP/CRM systems for pricing, stock, and project management.
Full BDM Dashboard: visibility into project specs, potential upsell opportunities, and competitor VE tracking.
Training & Certification Module: onboarding for new BDMs to understand tiering, pricing strategy, and value proposition.
Enhanced Visualisation Tools: show lux levels, beam angles, and other design aspects for specifiers within the app.
