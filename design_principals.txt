🔧 Key Design Principles (Reaffirmed)
✅ Transparency
Show every raw input and derived value clearly.
Engineers can audit the calculations step by step.
✅ Explain the ‘Why’ Behind the Numbers
Clearly identify what changed when a tier, length, or chip option is selected.
Don’t hide normalisation or fudge calculations—if they see 40% load, it’s real, and they can trace it.
✅ Give Full Control
They lock in choices after seeing data—no automated “optimisation” they can’t verify.
Provide live previews and full data outputs they can test in their workflows (AGI32, DIALux, etc.).
✅ Engineer-to-Engineer Respect
Assume they know what they’re doing—provide tools, not walls.
Let them override when they need, but show sane defaults.
✅ How This Is Reflected In What We’ve Built
1. IES Parsing and Reverse Lookup
Shows every photometric param, calculated lumens, lm/W, length, etc.
LumCAT breakdown shows exactly how the code was parsed.
Clean, structured tables—no clutter.
2. Tier Selection
Engineers see:
Parallel counts
Board lengths
Chip densities / efficiencies
mA per LED / per mm
Know why Pro has more headroom, why Advanced has finer increments.
3. Scaling Logic
Engineers select lengths → see buildable vs. non-buildable options.
Can see exactly how power density changes per length, pitch, and load %.
✅ What We Can Emphasise In The UI
Element	Purpose
Base Data Panel	Parsed IES, Derived Values, LumCAT lookup—raw facts.
Tier Impact Table	Side-by-side Core / Pro / Advanced: show how each changes load, performance, cost, life.
Selection Summary Table	Each length selection, why it works, what the result is.
Build Table	Luminaire schedule ready for BOM, all values traceable.
Export / Import	Engineers can resume work, not redo it.
✅ Final Message / Branding Consistency
“No smoke. No mirrors.
Just clear facts and performance numbers you can trust.”

✅ Next Logical Step
a. Move to Mock UI Implementation (facts-driven tier comparison + length scaling).
b. Build the Rule Engine for scaling → show exactly why lengths and loads change.
c. Plan for User Upload / Resume Previous Workflows, allowing iterative, fact-based adjustments.




✅ Absolutely aligned with that philosophy.
You’re building a tool for engineers, not marketers—a system that lays bare the facts, shows transparent scaling, and empowers data-driven decisions. No smoke. No mirrors. Just clarity.
