‚úÖ README FULL DOC - Draft v4.8
Linear LightSpec Optimiser v4.8
Fast, Accurate, Build-Ready Photometric Files
Powered by Evolt ‚Äì So much more than light.

üìñ Overview
Linear LightSpec Optimiser is a highly configurable photometric normalisation and optimisation tool designed for Lighting Designers, Engineers, and BDMs. It enables rapid generation and validation of luminaire photometric files (IES), delivering mm-accurate lengths, optimised LED power loads, and ensuring system uniformity for real-world buildability.

‚úÖ What It Does
Parses and analyses IES photometric data
Normalises LED Board & Chip Load Calculations
Scales Luminaire Lengths dynamically
Reverse lookup of LumCAT Codes
Exports AGI32 / DIALux compliant IES files (planned for v5.x)
üî® Key Features
Feature	Description
Live Length Validation	Ensures luminaire lengths are buildable & accurate
LED Pitch & Series/Parallel Configurations	Calculate accurate LED loads across varying designs
Optimise for Target Lux / Efficiency	Achieve desired light levels & balance efficacy
Scalable Length & Power Calculations	Scale luminaire lengths without compromising load uniformity
Live Efficacy & Wattage Feedback	Visual feedback on energy efficiency
LumCAT Reverse Lookup	Parse and validate product codes
Tier-Based Component Selection	Core / Pro / Advanced tiers, tied to Chip & Board configs
üõ†Ô∏è How It Works
Upload IES file
Tool auto-loads Default Board / LED Pitch based on configuration
Derived calculations include:
Total Lumens, lm/W, Lumens/meter
Actual mA per LED & per mm
User can:
Change LED Board / Chip / ECG
Scale Luminaire Length
Adjust LED Pitch or Max Load
Normalisation recalculates load sharing automatically
Data displayed in Parameters / Derived Values / LumCAT Lookup panes
Future v5.x: Export normalised IES & CSV
üì¶ Data Models & Spreadsheets
